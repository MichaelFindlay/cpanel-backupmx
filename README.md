cPanel-BackupMX
=====================
What does this script do?
This set of bash and automation scripts will assist you with configuring your cPanel DNS only installations to act as backup e-mail servers. It will support multiple full cPanel installs all syncing to one web space which merges and centrally manages all of the servers domains in to a single list downloaded by each of your DNS Servers.

Why did you create this script?
I had a need myself within my company utilising 5 DNS Servers world wide and cPanel web servers to be able to provide customers with a backup MX record on each of these for redundancy. I created these scripts for my own use but figured I would share them with the world to assist other cPanel sysadmins.

Prerequisites
- Webspace with FTP Access for you to Sync your domains to with ability to run bash scripts in Cron to merge the domains from all of your servers.
- a cPanel DNS Only Server
- A fully licensed installation of cPanel on a VPS or Dedicated Server
